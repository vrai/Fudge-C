All *.m4 macros are under the copyright of their respective authors.
This is usually AllPermissive (read MIT-style) or GPLwithACException
which is a GPL-style with exception of the results of m4 macroprocesor.

Special notice goes to the subdirectory ac-archive/ which contains the
m4 macros assembled by Peter Simons at http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to
His README AUTHORS COPYING is redistributed in that named subdirectory.

The source tarball contains additionally the complete buildchain to 
rebuild the website at http://ac-archive.sf.net, at the time of writing 
these are mostly python files under GPL or CC-BY-NC-SA free licenses.

Each source file should have its own author and copyright notice - if
the macro source code does not contain an explicit copyright notice then 
you should assume that the macro has been created with the license of the
autoconf project in the mind of the author. The original autoconf license 
is the GNU GPL with an exeception for the output of the macroprocessor used 
by the autoconf tools. 

== Autoconf Macro General Public License ==

Permission has been granted, though, to
use and distribute all macros under the following license, which is a
modified version of the GNU General Public License version 2:

Every Autoconf macro presented on this web site is free software;
you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU
General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
either version 2, or (at your option) any later version.

They are distributed in the hope that they will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
General Public License for more details. (You should have received a
copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if
not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place --
Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.)

As a special exception, the Free Software Foundation gives unlimited
permission to copy, distribute and modify the configure scripts that
are the output of Autoconf.  You need not follow the terms of the GNU
General Public License when using or distributing such scripts, even
though portions of the text of Autoconf appear in them.  The GNU
General Public License (GPL) does govern all other use of the material
that constitutes the Autoconf program.

Certain portions of the Autoconf source text are designed to be copied
(in certain cases, depending on the input) into the output of
Autoconf.  We call these the "data" portions.  The rest of the Autoconf
source text consists of comments plus executable code that decides which
of the data portions to output in any given case.  We call these
comments and executable code the "non-data" portions.  Autoconf never
copies any of the non-data portions into its output.

This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autoconf
released by the Free Software Foundation. When you make and distribute
a modified version of Autoconf, you may extend this special exception
to the GPL to apply to your modified version as well, *unless* your
modified version has the potential to copy into its output some of the
text that was the non-data portion of the version that you started
with. (In other words, unless your change moves or copies text from
the non-data portions to the data portions.) If your modification has
such potential, you must delete any notice of this special exception
to the GPL from your modified version.
